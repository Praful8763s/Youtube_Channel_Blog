      <p>Smart contracts represent one of the most transformative applications of blockchain technology, automating agreements and transactions without requiring trust in intermediaries. These self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code are revolutionizing how we think about agreements in the digital age.</p>
      
      <h2>Beyond Traditional Contracts</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional contracts that require third-party enforcement, smart contracts automatically execute when predefined conditions are met. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces costs, and minimizes the potential for disputes or fraud.</p>
      
      <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
      <p>Smart contracts are already being used in insurance (automatic payouts when conditions are verified), real estate (streamlining property transfers), supply chain (triggering payments upon delivery confirmation), and countless other industries where conditional transactions occur.</p>
      
      <h2>Technical Foundations</h2>
      <p>Most smart contracts today are built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Solana, or Polkadot. These platforms provide the security, immutability, and decentralized execution environment necessary for smart contracts to function as intended.</p>
